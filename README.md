# Overly-Delusional-Transcendence
An exciting and chaotic way to play commander with your friends



## Summary

Overly Delusional Transcendence or ODT for short, is a custom commander format where you will be able to challenge your friends deck building and creative capabilities.

The players will be given a *secret buddy* for which they will have to create an alternate winning condition and a small set of rules that will change the way that they will be build their decks and play their game.

Although the format is meant to be an interesting deck building experience for everyone its also in its core values to create chaotic, and awesomely retarded game boards and situations.

**BREAK THE GAME AS HARD AS YOU CAN**



## Rules

1. Each player will be assigned a secret buddy
2. Each player will then create a challenge or an alternate winning condition for their secret buddy
3. They can unban or ban cards for that specific player
4. They can create deck building and sideboard restrictions
5. They can permit what otherwise would be disallowed by commander rules
6. They can change the general MTG rules for that specific player



## Examples

**Rule 1:** Player A gets assigned Player B as his secret buddy. Time to create **chaos**!



**Rule 2:** Player A decides that it would be fun to make Player B win a game of commander through battle of wits, this is now Player B's **only way of winning the match**.



**Rule 3:** Player A searches for ways to be sure that this winning condition is **attainable**. After searching and finding some different ways to win through battle of wits he decides that the already known *Spawnsire of Ulamog* win is not fun enough so he **bans** the card for Player B. 

Player B is therefore **forbidden** to use the card in deck building.

If nothing else is said about bans and unbans it is assumed that the other banned cards of the commander format remain banned.



**Rule 4:** After pondering about the impact of deck building restrictions Player A decides that enchantments cannot be used by Player B (including battle of wits).

Player B is therefore **forbidden** to use enchantments in deck building.

Also after checking the ways that you can win with battle of wits in commander Player A decides to give Player B access to a sideboard.

By default if someone is given access to a sideboard it means that they can use any card they own from outside the game and **more** than 4 copies of each card. If players want to **limit** this rule in any way they can but they have to **specify the restrictions**.



**Rule 5:** Player A thinks that the challenge is currently very hard to accomplish so he changes the rules slightly to Player B by saying that his commander deck can have **up to 10 cards** that don't have the color identity of his commander, giving Player B the possibility of choosing a better commander for the strategy while not sacrificing their options for cards.



**Rule 6:** Player A wants to add a little chaos to the game so he creates a new rule for Player B.

In each of Player B's upkeeps that player selects one card from his hand and discards it. Then that player adds the bottom card of his deck to his hand.

Player A thinks this is not enough so he also adds a rule saying that Player B always skips his declare attackers step on all turns.



## Information Availability

Even though Player A and Player B will have access to all the information and rules above the other players **might not**.

To keep things more fun and interesting **no other player** other than Player A and Player B may know the secret winning condition that Player A created for Player B and **no other player** other than Player B may know that it was Player A who designed the rule set for Player B.

While game changing rules such as skipping a phase and other rules that are relevant for general gameplay must be known to every player, deck building rules **might** be hidden.

When creating rules for Player B, if Player A designs rules (such as deck building rules) that don't affect general gameplay, Player A **may specify** that the rule should be **hidden** from other players.

Any other rule that **is not specified as hidden** is **made public**.
